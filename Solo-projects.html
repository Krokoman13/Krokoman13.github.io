                <p>Like most people who want to be creative: I have a lot  of solo projects. Most of the finished ones I made becouse of/through my study, some of the most interesting ones I posted on this site.</p>

                    <p>My own C++ 2D Game Engine with basic phyhsics. As a challenge and a learning experiance I tried making a 2D engine and adding some physics to it.</p>
                    <p>The purpose was to learn more about memory menagment and ownership. Next to this I wanted to try impliment 2D collision handeling for shapes considing of lines and circles.</p>

                    <h1>Chess Mimic - My chess program</h1>
                    <p>The idea is that the program is able to sift through existing chess games between professionals or from advanced Chess Ai’s and remember what good moves are for specific board states.</p>
                    <p>This should be more efficient and easy than making an AI capable of calculating the good moves in real time.</p>

                    <h1>Alone in Space - Custom game engine</h1>
                    <p>Alone in space is a game about flying through space with somewhat realistic physics (frictionless) and you have to dodge or shoot incoming projectiles.</p>
                    <p>As part of my study I programmed this game in a custom engine (C# based), I mostly focused on Making it fun to control and learning how the engine works and how I could modify it.</p>

                    <p>The goal of this project was to make a custom physics engine with my own collision detection system.</p>
                    <p>To demonstrate that my engine works I was tasked to make a top down Tank shooting game.</p>

                    <p>SpellThief is a top-down game where the player explores a dungeon and acquires “Spellbooks” the player can cast spells based on their acquired Spellbooks. These Spellbooks are essential to overcoming the challenges in the dungeon, which vary from puzzles to combat.</p>
                    <p>As part of my study I had to make this game in Flowlab which was an interesting challange.</p>
