                    <h1>Dragonchess - Solo 3D Modeling/Printing project</h1>
                    <p>I Love playing Dungeons & Dragons, I like chess, When I learned that Dragonchess was an actual chess variant made by Gary Gygax I wanted to buy it!</p>
                    <p>When I learned I cant buy it I started having Ideas, when I studied Robotics I learned how to work with Solidworks which I aboslutly loved working with. Sadly, it is not a great program to make organic shapes which posed some challanges.</p> 
                    <p>I made sure to ask as much feedback from more talanted 3D artists I met through my study and incorporate that feedback as well as I could</p>
                    <p>My main goal was to try to have a consistant art style that still showed what the pieces where but still made it feel like chess.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>After about a year of working on it in my free time I finished it!</p>
                    <p>I published a picture of it on Reddit and the responses where amazing and I got tons of requests for the models which I then proceeded to publish on ThingyVerse</p>
                    <p>Via emails Gary Gygax told fans of the project that he had only ever played against himself before publishing the rules, which showed when I played it myself agaisnt friends.</p>
                    <p>Because of this I took the time to change some rules to great succes!</p> 
                    <br>
                    <p>This was a very fun project and it is proudly the most nerdy object I own!</p>
