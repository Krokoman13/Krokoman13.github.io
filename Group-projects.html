                    <h1>2 Meter Mayhem - Enviroment/NPC Programmer</h1>
                    <p>As part of a school project, we were tasked with making a game that could be part of an ad campaign. One of our team members thought of "Please give me space", a campaign to politely promote social distancing. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>So we made a game about how hard it is to shop in a grocery store and keep an eye on all other shoppers.</p>  
                    <br>
                    <p>My job was to make the store come alive, with groceries you could remove from the shelves, shoppers that wander around, and a friend that tries to reach you and does not respect your personal space.</p>
