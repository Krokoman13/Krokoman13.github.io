                    <h1>Souls of Steel - Second Engineer</h1>
                    <p>Souls of Steel is a cooperative stealth game set in Mariupol Ukraine. It is meant to let the player experience what it is like to live in Ukraine during the war.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>My main responsibilities were networking, AI/enemies, and stealth mechanics.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I was honored to have been asked for this project, and with a full team of 12 people we worked on 2 games for 9 weeks (this game was made in conjunction with Bound by Bonds).</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>This project was done in conjunction with Souls of Steel, it was my responsibility to port and alter all code from that game to this game and develop tools for the designers of Bound by Bonds.</p>

                    <h1>2 Meter Mayhem - Environment/NPC Programmer</h1>
                    <p>As part of a university project, we were tasked with making a game that could be part of an ad campaign. One of our team members thought of "Please give me space", a campaign to politely promote social distancing. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>So we made a game about how hard it is to shop in a grocery store and keep an eye on all other shoppers.</p>  
                    <br>
                    <p>My job was to make the store come alive, with groceries you could remove from the shelves, shoppers that wander around, and a friend that tries to reach you and does not respect your personal space.</p>

                    <p> We were tasked with making a physics-based puzzle game. For this, we were supposed to use our own physics system. </p>

                    <p>We used one I had developed for C# before this project.</p>
