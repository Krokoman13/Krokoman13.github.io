                    <h1>Internship @ Innobrix - Full Stack 3D Typescript Developper</h1>
                    <p>Innobrix is a company and a web-based platform that lets customers make 3D customizable visualizations of, primarily, homes, buildings, or neighbourhoods, to, for instance, portray or sell these on their website.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I was interested in this company because they used tools, rendering techniques, and programming languages in an environment I had no experience.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I had the pleasure of working with this company as a full-time Intern for 6 months, because it was such a mutual success I decided to work during my summer vacation for an extra month, at which point I had to resume my bachelor's.</p>
                    <p>I have worked on many features, and posted some of the most noteworthy ones here.</p>

                    <p>The resizable platform was made to replace a non-resizable 3D model which would sometimes not fit large buidlings or too many small ones.</p>
                    <p>It was designed to improve the UX and profesionality of the Innobrix System.</p>

                    <h1>Drag & Drop Textures</h1>
                    <p>The workflow of changing textues on a model used to be slow and tedius.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I developped a way to change textures by hovering the desired over the relevant part. When the mouse releases it actually changes the texture, before than it shows what it would look like.</p>
                    <p>This feature significantly increases the speed at which clients can swap textures.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This feature is currently in use on the Innobrix platform.</p>

                    <h1>OBJ Pipleline - Frontend</h1>
                    <p>The Innobrix Platform was originally designed to work exclusivly with the 3D modelling software: AutoDesk Revit. It was decided that, in order to work with other softwares, it would also work with OBJ & GLB models.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This was a large feature developped by multiple developpers within the company.</p>
                    <p>My task was to rework the front-end part of the process, specifically, to make a way to preview of the model and send all the relevant data to the back-end. It was important that the user could specify the orientation, unit size, and software of origin, and how that would impact the how the model looked.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This finished feature is currently in use on the Innobrix platform.</p>
