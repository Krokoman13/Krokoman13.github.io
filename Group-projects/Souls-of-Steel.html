                    <h1>Souls of Steel</h1>
                    <p>Souls of Steel is a 2 player cooperative stealth game set in Mariupol Ukraine. It is meant to let the player experiance what it is like to live in Ukraine during war.</p>
                    <p>It is about a boy who joins the army and tries to help the other sitizens in Mariupol which is under siege and needs the assistance of a drone to navigate the dangers.</p>
                    <p>As part of a study project we where supposed to work on one game for 9 weeks and I was approached by an Ukranian friend of mine.</p>

                    <p>I mainly had the job to make the interactions between the two players, one of which controlled a drone and the other the human soldier. I was responsible for the two players connecting together using internet, making sure everything was synched and the game worked diffrently based on the chosen role.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I made the drone powers, it has a minimap capable of seeing their own and player positions, it also showed the objectives and coming airstrikes. It also could see mines that where less visible to the soldier</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Next to this I was also responsible for patrolling enemies that would try to find and shoot the soldier player. So I made a system to specify a specific path for soldier to patrol and a system that would let the designers specify the enemy shooting behaviour.When a soldier would see or hear the human player it would try to get as close as possible to the last known location and try shoot them if visible according to that behaviour.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This project was an amazing experiance because I had never worked on a project with this scope before, it felt great to work on a project so dear to my friends and teammates hearts. And I think we made something really amazing.</p>
