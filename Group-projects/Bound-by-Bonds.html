                    <h1>Bound by Bonds</h1>
                    <p>Bound by Bonds is a 2 player interactive story experiance. It is meant to let the player experiance what it is like to live in Ukraine during war.</p>
                    <p>It is about two siblings wo thry to find eachtother in the war-torn Mariupol as the landmarks remind them of their childhoods.</p>
                    <p>As part of a study project we where supposed to work on one game for 9 weeks and I was approached by an Ukranian friend of mine.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I was honored to have been asked for this project, and with a full team of 12 people we worked on 2 games for 9 weeks: Bound by Bonds and <a href="Souls-of-Steel.html">Souls of Steel</a>.</p>

                    <p>Our team worked on two games, us engineers where mainly supposed to work on the other game, <a href="Souls-of-Steel.html">Souls of Steel</a>, Bound by bonds was supposed to need less programming and/or be able to use code from Souls of Steel.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The game still needed someone who was knowlageble of Unity and how it works and can make small tools and interactions and was able to port code from one game to the other, that was me. Working on two games at the same time like this and trying to make and teach tools for the designers from Bound by Bonds while I mostly worked on Souls of Steel was an interesting and educative experiance.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In the end we made a beutifully heartbreaking game of which I am proud to have played a part.</p>
